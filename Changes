{{$NEXT}}

    - Fix trivial POD errors I didn't spot in the 0.02 release.

0.02 2013-09-15 15:28:10

    - Huge release with lots of new features and bugfixes.

    - Added an 'after' callback.

    - Added a 'stash' method / option.

    - Don't re-generate constants if someone subclasses the consatnt
      exporter.

    - Only export constant when explicitly requested, not everything
      we $ctx->call(...). Removes leaks in the API.

    - Correct behavior for skipping the interning of constants in the
      stash during override *only* for those constants we're
      overriding, not everything else.

    - Add tests for interop with constant.pm

    - Huge POD rewrite and lots of tests / examples added.
