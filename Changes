Revision history for Constant::Export::Lazy

{{$NEXT}}

    - This is a major release

    - A new private_name_munger option is now available both globally
      and locally per-constant. This can be used to obscure the
      internal names of generated constants, to avoid hard to track
      down errors related to using lazy constants someone else might
      define for you (and then suddenly stop doing so).

    - When using the wrap_existing_import option the $ctx->call()
      method wouldn't work with some constant.pm-generated
      subroutines. This has now been exhaustively fixed.

    - After a lot of playing around with test coverage the test
      coverage of this module is now 100%. A few minor bugs were fixed
      in the process of achieving this.

    - Some minor documentation improvements, mainly rewording existing
      sentences.

    - Huge release with lots of new features and bugfixes.

    - Added an 'after' callback.

    - Added a 'stash' method / option.

    - Don't re-generate constants if someone subclasses the consatnt
      exporter.

    - Only export constant when explicitly requested, not everything
      we $ctx->call(...). Removes leaks in the API.

    - Correct behavior for skipping the interning of constants in the
      stash during override *only* for those constants we're
      overriding, not everything else.

    - Add tests for interop with constant.pm

    - Huge POD rewrite and lots of tests / examples added.
